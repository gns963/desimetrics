        Electricity bills
      </h2>
      <p>
        Actual bills can differ from our estimates due to rounding, meter rent,
        one-time charges and tariff revisions between our last verification and
        your billing date. Some components are deliberately not modelled,
        including Maharashtra&apos;s wheeling charge and fuel adjustment, West
        Bengal&apos;s monthly MVCA surcharge, and Kerala&apos;s non-telescopic
        rate above 250 units a month. These limits are noted on the relevant
        calculators; see our{' '}

        Solar and AC
      </h2>
      <p>
        Solar savings, system costs and payback use indicative benchmarks and a
        typical generation assumption; real quotes and output vary by location,
        shading and installer. AC running costs assume a standard compressor duty
        factor and ISEER bands. Treat both as planning estimates.

        Financial calculators

      <p>
        GST, SIP, income-tax and gratuity tools are for general guidance only and
        are not tax, legal or investment advice. The income-tax calculator does
        not model surcharge (income above ₹50 lakh) or marginal relief, and SIP
        figures are gross of expense ratio and capital-gains tax. SIP returns are
        market-linked and not guaranteed. Consult a qualified professional before
        acting.
