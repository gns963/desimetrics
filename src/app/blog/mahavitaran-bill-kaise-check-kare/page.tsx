    q: 'Are Mahavitaran and MSEDCL the same company?',
    a: 'Yes. "Mahavitaran" is simply the common name people use for MSEDCL — Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd, the wholly government-owned utility that supplies power across most of Maharashtra. They are not two different companies; every Mahavitaran bill is an MSEDCL bill.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How do I check my Mahavitaran bill online?',
    a: 'Go to the official portal at mahadiscom.in and use the Web Self Service (WSS) / Consumer Portal section to view and pay your bill using your consumer number. You can also check it through the official Mahavitaran Consumer App, including as a guest without registering.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How do I pay my Mahavitaran bill?',
    a: 'Once you\'ve located your bill on mahadiscom.in or the Mahavitaran app, you can pay using UPI, a debit or credit card, net banking, or a supported e-wallet — the same payment options are generally available on both the website and the app.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Where do I find my Mahavitaran consumer number?',
    a: 'Your consumer number is printed on any previous MSEDCL/Mahavitaran bill, usually as a 12-digit number. Some portal flows also ask for your consumer type and a Billing Unit (BU) code, which identifies your local circle — both are also found on your paper or PDF bill.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does Mahavitaran (MSEDCL) supply electricity in Mumbai?',
    a: 'No, not within Mumbai city itself. MSEDCL/Mahavitaran covers most of Maharashtra, but Mumbai city is served separately by Adani Electricity, Tata Power, and BEST depending on the area. If you\'re in Mumbai city and searching for a Mahavitaran bill, you\'re very likely actually on one of those three instead.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Why is my Mahavitaran bill higher than usual?',
    a: 'MSEDCL bills electricity using telescopic slabs, where higher consumption pushes more of your usage into pricier rate bands — so a genuine increase in units used can raise your bill more than proportionally. Check your actual units against MSEDCL\'s real slab structure using a calculator rather than guessing.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How do I check my Mahavitaran bill payment history?',
    a: 'Your payment and bill history is available after logging into the Web Self Service portal on mahadiscom.in or the Mahavitaran Consumer App with your consumer number. Exactly how many past months are shown can vary, so check what\'s currently available in your own account rather than assuming a fixed window.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I pay my Mahavitaran bill without creating an account?',
    a: 'Yes — the official Mahavitaran Consumer App supports a guest login that lets you view and pay a bill using just your consumer number, without registering an account. The website portal may also offer a similar quick-pay option; check mahadiscom.in for what\'s currently available.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How do I file a complaint with Mahavitaran?',
    a: 'Complaints can generally be raised and tracked through the Mahavitaran Consumer App or the mahadiscom.in portal. Before filing one over a billing amount, it helps to first check your consumption against MSEDCL\'s actual slab rates, since a jump in usage is a common, non-faulty cause of a higher bill.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is the Mahavitaran app available in languages other than English?',
    a: 'Yes — the official Mahavitaran Consumer App is available in both English and Marathi, which is one reason it\'s often the easier option for many users compared to the website portal.',

          <strong>Mahavitaran</strong> and <strong>MSEDCL</strong> (Maharashtra State
          Electricity Distribution Co. Ltd) are the <strong>same company</strong> —
          Mahavitaran is simply the common name people use for it. This wholly
          government-owned utility supplies power to most of Maharashtra, with one major
          exception: <strong>Mumbai city itself is not served by Mahavitaran</strong> —
          it&apos;s covered separately by Adani Electricity, Tata Power and BEST. This

          <p className={pCls}>
            Mahavitaran is one of India&apos;s largest power distribution utilities (sources
            differ on the exact ranking, so we won&apos;t claim a specific number one or two
            here), wholly owned by the Maharashtra government. It bills and supplies
            electricity to the large majority of the state — but not to Mumbai city, which
            has its own separate distribution companies.

            billing amount, it&apos;s worth first checking two things: your actual
            consumption against MSEDCL&apos;s real slab structure (see the calculator
            above), and your meter reading date, since a reading taken later than usual can
            make one bill look artificially high by covering more days than normal.
          </p>
          <p className={`mt-3 ${pCls}`}>
            If those checks don&apos;t explain the discrepancy, use the complaint option in
            the app or portal, or the customer-care details listed on your current bill —
            we won&apos;t print a specific number here since these change without much
            notice; always confirm it on mahadiscom.in.

            Takeaway: check consumption and reading dates first — most billing surprises
            trace back to one of those two, not a system error.
