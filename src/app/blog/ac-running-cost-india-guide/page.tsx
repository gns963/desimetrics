  {
    q: 'How much electricity does a 1.5-ton AC use per hour?',
    a: 'A typical 1.5-ton AC draws roughly 0.84–1.1 kWh (units) per hour depending on its star rating — around 840W for a 5-star model and around 1,104W for a 3-star model, illustratively. Actual draw varies by brand, model and operating conditions, so treat this as a planning range, not an exact figure.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How is AC running cost calculated?',
    a: 'Multiply the AC\'s power draw in kW by the hours you run it per day, then by the number of days, to get monthly units (kWh). Apply your own state\'s per-unit electricity rate to those units — since rates rise across telescopic slabs, the exact rupee cost depends on your total monthly usage, not a flat multiplication.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is a 5-star AC actually worth the extra money?',
    a: 'Usually yes if you run the AC 8+ hours a day, since the roughly ₹7,000–10,000 price premium over a comparable 3-star model typically pays back in about 4–6 years from electricity savings. For lighter use (4–5 hours a day), a 3-star model is often the more balanced economic choice.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Why is my new AC\'s star rating lower than my old one?',
    a: 'The Bureau of Energy Efficiency raised the efficiency bar for every star category starting January 2026 — a model that would have qualified as 5-star under 2025 rules is now labelled 4-star. The AC\'s actual cooling performance hasn\'t changed; only the rating threshold moved higher.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does running an AC in extreme heat use more power than its rated capacity?',
    a: 'It can. An independent Centre for Science and Environment study found some 5-star ACs drawing 10–28% more power than their declared capacity in peak summer heat (around 40–50°C), since the labelled figure is measured under standard lab conditions, not real extreme-heat operation.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What size AC do I need for my room?',
    a: 'Tonnage should scale with your room\'s size, sun exposure and floor level, not just square footage — an undersized AC runs longer and harder to compensate, while an oversized one cycles on and off inefficiently. Use a tonnage calculator with your room\'s actual dimensions rather than guessing.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does an inverter AC use less electricity than a normal AC?',
    a: 'Generally yes for typical Indian usage patterns, since an inverter AC adjusts its compressor speed to maintain temperature instead of switching fully on and off, which usually reduces overall power draw compared to a non-inverter unit of the same tonnage and star rating — though exact savings vary by model and usage.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How many hours a day is it safe/economical to run an AC?',
    a: 'There\'s no fixed universal number — it\'s a cost-vs-comfort tradeoff. What matters economically is understanding that more hours means more units, and units late in the month can land in a pricier tariff slab, so check your own running cost using your actual hours rather than assuming a "safe" limit.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Why does my AC push my electricity bill into a higher slab?',
    a: 'Most Indian electricity boards bill households using telescopic slabs, where your bill rises faster once total monthly units cross a threshold. An AC can easily add 150–250+ units a month, which is often enough on its own to push your household into a costlier slab for that portion of usage.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How much can I save per year by choosing a 5-star AC over a 3-star one?',
    a: 'It depends heavily on your daily hours of use and your local tariff, since the efficiency gap (typically 20–28% less energy for a comparable 5-star vs 3-star model) applies to a number of units that differs by household. Use a running-cost calculator with your own hours and tariff for a real annual figure.',

          AC running cost comes down to one formula: <strong>wattage × hours used × your
          per-unit electricity rate</strong>. The tricky part is that last variable — your
          tariff isn&apos;t a flat number, it rises inside telescopic slabs as your total
          monthly usage climbs, and it varies enormously by state. A star-rating chart alone,
          without your own tariff plugged in, will give you a wrong number.
        </p>

            How Is AC Running Cost Actually Calculated?
          </h2>
          <p className={pCls}>
            Start with the AC&apos;s power draw in kilowatts (kW) — a 1.5-ton AC might draw
            somewhere around 0.84 to 1.1 kW depending on its star rating. Multiply that by
            the hours you run it per day to get kilowatt-hours (kWh), which is the same thing
            as one &ldquo;unit&rdquo; on your electricity bill. Multiply again by the number
            of days in the billing period to get your AC&apos;s monthly unit contribution.
          </p>
          <p className={`mt-3 ${pCls}`}>
            The last step — turning units into rupees — is where most generic AC-cost content
            goes wrong. Most Indian electricity boards bill households using{' '}
            <Link href="/blog/how-telescopic-electricity-slabs-work" className="text-brass underline">
              telescopic slabs
            </Link>
            , so the units your AC adds late in the month can be billed at a higher rate than
            your household&apos;s first units. The same AC, run the same hours, can cost
            meaningfully different amounts in different states — or even in the same home
            across a light-usage vs heavy-usage month.
          </p>
          <p className={takeawayCls}>
            Takeaway: wattage and hours give you units — your own slab structure is what turns
            units into an actual rupee cost.

            Starting January 2026, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency raised the efficiency
            threshold required to earn each star category. In practice: a model that would

            Getting tonnage right matters for cost either way. An undersized AC has to run
            longer and work harder to reach your set temperature, which can end up costing
            more overall despite the lower upfront price. An oversized AC cools the room too
            quickly and then cycles on and off frequently, which is also inefficient and can
            leave the room feeling clammy since it doesn&apos;t run long enough to
            dehumidify properly.

          <p className={`mt-3 ${pCls}`}>
            Tonnage should scale with your room&apos;s actual size, sun exposure and floor
            level — not a rough guess. Use our{' '}

            Takeaway: both undersized and oversized ACs waste money — get your tonnage sized to
