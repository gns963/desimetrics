  {
    q: 'Does rooftop solar work during a power cut?',
    a: 'No — a standard grid-tied solar system automatically shuts off during a power cut, for the safety of linesmen working on the grid. To keep power flowing during an outage, you need a hybrid inverter with a battery, which adds meaningful extra cost.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I need a battery for rooftop solar?',
    a: 'Not for a standard grid-tied system using net metering — your excess daytime power is exported to the grid instead of stored. A battery is only needed if you specifically want backup power during outages.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How much roof space does a 3kW solar system need?',
    a: 'Roughly 300 sq ft is commonly cited, based on about 100 sq ft per kW of panels, though this varies by panel efficiency and layout. Use a panel size calculator with your own roof dimensions for an accurate figure.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is the PM Surya Ghar subsidy the same in every state?',
    a: 'The central subsidy — ₹30,000/kW for the first 2kW and ₹18,000 for the 3rd kW, capped at ₹78,000 — is the same nationwide. Some states offer additional top-up subsidies on top of this, so check your state government’s current scheme too.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What happens to solar savings if electricity tariffs go up?',
    a: 'Your savings actually improve, since every unit your panels generate offsets a unit you would otherwise have bought at the new, higher rate. This is a big reason solar economics have gotten better as urban tariffs have risen.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I install rooftop solar on a rented house?',
    a: 'It is technically possible with the landlord’s consent, but subsidy applications and net-metering paperwork are usually filed against the property owner’s name. In practice, rooftop solar is best suited to homes you own or plan to stay in long-term.',

        <p className={`mt-6 text-lg ${pCls}`}>
          For most homeowners with a suitable, unshaded roof, <strong>rooftop solar is
          worth it in India in 2026</strong> — a typical 3kW system now pays back its
          net cost in roughly <strong>3 to 6 years</strong> after the PM Surya Ghar
          subsidy, then keeps saving for most of its 25-year panel life. It pays off
          fastest for households with a high daytime electricity bill on a top tariff
          slab, and slowest for low-usage homes or states with weak net-metering
          rules.
        </p>

        <section aria-labelledby="cost" className="mt-10 scroll-mt-20">
          <h2 id="cost" className={h2Cls}>
            What Does Rooftop Solar Actually Cost in 2026?
          </h2>
          <p className={pCls}>
            A typical residential 3kW system — enough for many small Indian
            households — commonly costs somewhere around{' '}
            <strong>₹1.5–1.9 lakh before subsidy</strong>, depending on your
            installer, panel brand and state. Larger or premium systems cost
            proportionally more.
          </p>
          <p className={`mt-3 ${pCls}`}>
            After the central subsidy, the same 3kW system typically nets out to
            roughly <strong>₹75,000–1.1 lakh</strong>. These are commonly cited
            ranges, not fixed prices — always get quotes from MNRE-empanelled
            installers for your specific roof.
          </p>
          <p className={takeawayCls}>
            Takeaway: Expect a 3kW system to cost roughly ₹1.5–1.9 lakh before
            subsidy, and about ₹75,000–1.1 lakh after it — treat any quote outside
            this range with a closer look.

            How Much Subsidy Can You Get Under PM Surya Ghar?
          </h2>
          <p className={pCls}>
            The <strong>PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana</strong> is the central
            government&apos;s rooftop solar subsidy scheme. It pays{' '}
            <strong>₹30,000 per kW for the first 2kW</strong>, and{' '}
            <strong>₹18,000 for the 3rd kW</strong> — so a 3kW system or larger gets
            the full <strong>₹78,000</strong> cap.
          </p>
          <p className={`mt-3 ${pCls}`}>
            Some state governments add their own top-up subsidy on top of the
            central amount — check your state&apos;s renewable energy department for
            any additional scheme, since this varies and isn&apos;t modelled by the

          </p>
          <p className={takeawayCls}>
            Takeaway: The central subsidy alone can cover roughly 40–50% of a 3kW
            system&apos;s upfront cost — check for a state top-up on top of that.

            How Long Does It Take to Recover the Cost (Payback Period)?
          </h2>
          <p className={pCls}>
            &ldquo;Payback period&rdquo; simply means how long it takes for your
            monthly electricity savings to add up to what you spent on the system.
            As of 2026, a payback of <strong>3 to 6 years</strong> is commonly cited
            for a well-sized residential system after subsidy — but this is a range,
            not a guarantee, and depends heavily on your own numbers.
          </p>
          <p className={`mt-3 ${pCls}`}>
            Reported payback periods vary widely across sources because they depend
            on your state&apos;s electricity tariff, how much power you actually use
            during daylight hours, and your DISCOM&apos;s{' '}

              net metering
            </Link>{' '}
            rules — the policy that credits you for solar power you export back to
            the grid instead of using yourself. A DISCOM (Distribution Company) is
            simply the utility that supplies and bills your electricity.
          </p>
          <p className={takeawayCls}>
            Takeaway: Treat &ldquo;3–6 years&rdquo; as a realistic planning range, and
            run your own numbers rather than trusting one number from an installer&apos;s
            brochure.

              ['Daytime usage pattern', 'Homes that use more power during daylight hours get more value from self-consumption than from lower-value grid export credit.'],
              ['Your state\'s net metering rules', 'A generous export credit rate speeds up payback; a weak one slows it down significantly.'],
              ['Roof orientation and shading', 'A shaded or non-south-facing roof generates less power for the same panel count, stretching out payback.'],

          </ul>
          <p className={takeawayCls}>
            Takeaway: Payback speed is mostly about your tariff and your daytime
            usage pattern — the same system pays back much faster in a high-tariff,
            high-daytime-usage home than a low-usage one.
