        What cookies are
      </h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small text files stored by your browser. They let a site
        remember preferences and help us and our partners understand how the site
        is used.

        Types we use
      </h2>
      <ul className="list-disc space-y-1 pl-5">
        <li>
          <strong>Essential</strong> — needed for the site to function and remember
          basic preferences such as light/dark theme.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Analytics</strong> — help us measure aggregate, anonymised usage
          so we can improve the calculators.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Advertising</strong> — once ads are enabled, third-party vendors
          including Google use cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) to serve
          and measure ads based on your visits to this and other sites.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Affiliate</strong> — some outbound retailer links set cookies so
          a qualifying purchase can be attributed to us.
        </li>
      </ul>
