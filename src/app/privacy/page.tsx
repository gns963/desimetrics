        Calculators run in your browser
      </h2>
      <p>
        The numbers you type into our calculators (units, income, system size and
        so on) are processed entirely in your browser to show a result. They are
        not transmitted to or stored on our servers.

      <h2 className="font-display text-xl font-semibold text-ash">
        Information you submit
      </h2>
      <p>
        If you use our solar installer lead form, you provide details such as PIN
        code, monthly bill amount, roof type and phone number. This information is
        used only to connect you with relevant installers. We will describe exactly
        how it is stored and shared before that feature is switched on; today the
        form does not transmit or store data.
      </p>

      <h2 className="font-display text-xl font-semibold text-ash">
        Analytics
      </h2>
      <p>
        We may use privacy-respecting analytics to understand aggregate,
        anonymised usage — for example which calculators are popular — so we can
        improve the site. This does not identify you personally.
